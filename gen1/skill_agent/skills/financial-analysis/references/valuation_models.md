# Valuation Models

## 1. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

### Formula
Intrinsic Value = Σ [FCF_t / (1 + r)^t] + Terminal Value / (1 + r)^n

### Inputs Required
- Free Cash Flow projections (5–10 years)
- Discount rate / WACC (typically 8–12%)
- Terminal growth rate (typically 2–3%)

### Steps
1. Project FCF for 5 years using revenue growth assumptions
2. Calculate Terminal Value = FCF_n × (1 + g) / (r - g)
3. Discount all cash flows to present value
4. Sum = Intrinsic Value
5. Compare to current market cap

### Sensitivity Table
Run with WACC ± 1% and terminal growth ± 0.5% to show range.

## 2. Comparable Company Analysis (Comps)

### Steps
1. Identify 5–8 comparable public companies (same sector, size)
2. Pull EV/EBITDA, P/E, P/S for each
3. Calculate median multiples
4. Apply median to subject company's metrics
5. Output implied valuation range

## 3. Precedent Transactions

### Steps
1. Find recent M&A transactions in the sector (last 3 years)
2. Note acquisition multiples paid (EV/EBITDA, EV/Revenue)
3. Apply transaction premium (typically 20–30% over market)
4. Output implied acquisition valuation
